My Internship Project completely codded in MATLAB.
This project was done as part of the Internship carried out in IIT Madras in the summer break on 2021

The file section_properties.m contains the code for finding sectional properties of thin-walled structures.

Input is given in form of nodes and co-ordinates from excel sheets.

The program returns the sectional properties such as Centre of gravity, Moment of inertias, area of the complete cross section, Principal moment of Inertias and angle of inclination of the principal axis with global axis.

Additionally, the properties of back-to-back attached sections and box sections formed from single section is also returned 

The test file contains the excel worksheet with Input data 

The results contain the result for the input data provided in test file
